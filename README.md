## Introduction
Same as Chromium OS, jemaos adopts the [Portage build and packaging system](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Portage) from Gentoo Linux. jemaos uses Portage with certain customisations to support building multiple targets (bootable OS system images) across different hardware architectures from a shared set of sources.

A **board** defines a target type, it can be either for a family of hardware devices or specifically for one type of device. For example, The board `amd64-jemaos_iris` is a target type for an jemaos system image that aims to run on most recent PCs with amd64(x86_64) architecture; whilst the `rpi4-jemaos` board is a target type specifically for the infamous single-board computer [Raspberry Pi 4B](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/). We usually append `-jemaos` to the board name in jemaos to differentiate between its siblings for jemaos. 

Each board has a corresponding **overlay** that defines the configuration for it. This includes details like CPU architecture, kernel configuration, as well as additional packages and USE flags.

## About the board `amd64-jemaos_iris`
This board targets a generically bootable jemaos image on most Intel-powered x86_64 PC devices, specifically, the device should have:
 - Intel CPUs released on or after the year 2017, specifically, Intel 9th generation Coreâ„¢ Processors ["Coffee Lake"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_Lake) and later
 - Intel Pentium processors released on or after the year 2017, specifically, Intel Pentium SoC ["Coffee Lake"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium) or later
 - Integrated Intel HD graphics

 `amd64-jemaos_iris` is the variant for [jemaos for iris](https://jemaos.com/download/pc/intel-iris) release.
